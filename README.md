Just left the theater and my head is still spinning. Popcorn everywhere, might need a whole vacuum crew for this. Last Bullet just blew holes in my brain, but like in a hot air balloon way, floating with disbelief — half expecting Tom Cruise to parachute through the screen even though he wasn’t even in it ??

There was this scene, this chaotic car chase, and all I could think was did I leave the oven on? Strange how the sound of explosions can trigger home anxiety. The noise! Like someone decided to plug a pair of bagpipes into an amplifier — painful enough to create memories, fragrant popcorn smell kind of stuck to my coat now like an unwanted perfume. Oh, and my back. How have movie theater seats not improved since the invention of the recliner?

> The moment! When the protagonist finally realized his friend was the double agent — I swear, just like that time I found out my wore out socks had holes, right before a big meeting — shocking, embarrassing, oddly nostalgic. You just can’t run away from hidden betrayals, or toe exposure. The entire theater gasped as if synchronized for a brief second, reminded me of synchronized swimming, but with sadness?

I should remember to download the movie later because someone said they wanted to watch the movie but memory and me, well, that’s a hilarious sitcom waiting to happen. There was a scene with a garden gnome for no logical reason; it felt like the director watched too many DIY shows and slipped that in while sleep-deprived.

Some of the dialogue had the rhythm of legal jargon—probably why I felt oddly at home, as if I'd wandered into the courtroom but instead of objection, it was explosions making my heart dance erratically.

Quite sure this wasn’t what I intended to write but hey, movies, they mess with your code, your thinking, and your snack-eating posture.
